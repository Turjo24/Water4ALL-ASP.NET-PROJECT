## **Objective**
The objective of the **“Water4All”** platform is to facilitate the efficient distribution of water by connecting donors, buyers, and volunteers. The platform enables users to request or donate water, sell water to those in need, and allows volunteers to manage and follow up on leads to ensure timely delivery. By streamlining these processes, the system aims to promote community support, reduce water scarcity, and ensure that clean water reaches those who require it most.
